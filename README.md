# Corporate Agent â€” ADGM Doc Reviewer (MVP)

This repository contains two Streamlit apps for reviewing ADGM-related corporate documents:

- **Classic Rule-Based Reviewer (`app.py` + `reviewer.py`)**  
  Detects document types, checks for required files, highlights legal red flags, and annotates `.docx` files with comments and a structured JSON summary.

- **RAG-Powered Reviewer (`app1.py` + `rag_reviewer.py`)**  
  Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an LLM (OpenAI GPT or Gemini) and FAISS to retrieve relevant context from your documents and generate a structured review.

---

## Features

- Upload `.docx` files for review
- Automatic detection of document type (e.g., Articles of Association, UBO Declaration)
- Checklist verification for ADGM processes (e.g., company incorporation)
- Highlights issues such as ambiguous language, missing signatures, and incorrect jurisdiction references
- Annotated `.docx` download for each file (classic version)
- Structured JSON summary of findings
- RAG version: retrieves relevant context and generates a review using an LLM
